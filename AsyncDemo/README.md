# AsyncDemo
Demo ASP.NET web app for CS95N at LCC


## Directory

* AsyncDemo.Console: Demonstrates using async / await with a Task object. The main calls an async method that contains a time delay to simulate a long-running operation.
* AsyncDemo.Razor: Demonstrates using async / await with a Task object. One of the event handlers is an async method and it makes multiple calls to a private async method so that all three calls run in parallel.

I wrote this app for use with CS295N, Web Development 1:ASP.NET Android, a class I teach at Lane Community College.
